SkyFly — Animated Flight Booking (starter)
=========================================

What's included
- Vite + React starter
- Tailwind CSS setup files (config + postcss)
- GSAP with ScrollTrigger + MotionPath usage example
- Simple hero with plane motion and looping clouds
- Multiple sections to demonstrate scroll behavior

Setup
1. Node.js >= 18 recommended.
2. Run:
   npm install
   npm run dev

Notes
- Tailwind, PostCSS and Vite are wired in package.json devDependencies. If you prefer yarn, use yarn instead.
- The project uses local SVGs (public/*.svg). Replace them with high-quality assets for production.
- MotionPath is used for demo path animation; tweak the coordinates inside src/components/Hero.jsx.

Deploy
- Deploy to Vercel by connecting the repository or simply drag & drop the built output (npm run build) into your host of choice.

Enjoy! ✈️
